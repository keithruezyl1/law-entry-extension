last_reviewed: string    // ISO date (auto-set to current date for new entries)
created_by: number       // Team member ID (e.g., 1 for Arda)
created_at: string       // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string       // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
embedding: string        // Vector embedding (auto-generated for imported entries)
```

### **üîí Access Control**
```javascript
visibility: {
  gli: boolean,         // General Legal Information (usually true)
  cpa: boolean         // CPA mode (usually true for ordinances)
}
```

legal_bases: object[]           // Optional: legal bases with full details (Step 4)
```

### **üìã Citation Format for References (related_sections & legal_bases)**
```javascript
// External references (legal_bases)
{
  "type": "external",         // For external legal documents
  "citation": "string",       // Full citation text (e.g., "Republic Act No. 4136 (1964)")
  "url": "string",           // Complete URL
  "title": "string",         // Document title (e.g., "Land Transportation and Traffic Code")

}

// Internal references (related_sections)
{
  "type": "internal",         // For related ordinance sections
  "entry_id": "string",       // Entry ID of related section

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `ORD-{CityName}-{OrdinanceNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `ORD-CebuCity-Ordinance1234-Sec5-663202`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on jurisdiction, law_family, section_id and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^ORD-[A-Za-z0-9]+-[A-Za-z0-9]+-[A-Za-z0-9]+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `ORD-` for city ordinance sections
2. **City Name:** Extracted from the `jurisdiction` field:
   - `"PH-CEBU-CITY"` ‚Üí `"CebuCity"`
3. **Ordinance Number:** Extracted from the `law_family` field:
   - `"Cebu City Ordinance No. 1234"` ‚Üí `"Ordinance1234"`
4. **Section ID:** Extracted from the `section_id` field:
   - `"Sec. 5"` ‚Üí `"Sec5"`
5. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
6. **Final Format:** `ORD-{CityName}-{OrdinanceNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input jurisdiction: "PH-CEBU-CITY"
// Input law_family: "Cebu City Ordinance No. 1234"
// Input section_id: "Sec. 5"
// Generated entry_id: "ORD-CebuCity-Ordinance1234-Sec5-663202"

// Input jurisdiction: "PH-CEBU-CITY"
// Input law_family: "Cebu City Traffic Code"
// Input section_id: "Art. 3"
// Generated entry_id: "ORD-CebuCity-TrafficCode-Art3-789012"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same section
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Section ID extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow ORD-{CityName}-{OrdinanceNumber}-{SectionID}-{timestamp} format
type: "city_ordinance_section"  // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be valid jurisdiction (e.g., "PH-CEBU-CITY")
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character (e.g., "Cebu City Ordinance No. 1234")
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z")
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z")
elements: string[]      // Must have at least 1 element (city_ordinance_section specific)
penalties: string[]     // Must have at least 1 penalty (city_ordinance_section specific)
created_by: number      // Team member ID (e.g., 1 for Arda)
created_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)
- `elements` and `penalties` arrays must have at least one item each

### **Vector Embeddings for Imported Entries**
- **Auto-generated:** When entries are imported via JSON, the system automatically generates vector embeddings
- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and AI-powered retrieval functionality
- **Format:** Large array of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.018105285,0.03040041,0.0018285423,...]`)
- **No manual input required:** The embedding field is populated automatically during import
- **Search enhancement:** Embeddings allow the system to find related entries based on semantic meaning, not just exact text matches

### **Import-Specific Field Handling**
- **Created By:** Automatically set to the logged-in user's information
  - `created_by`: Uses the logged-in user's ID (e.g., 1 for Arda)
  - `created_by_name`: Uses the logged-in user's name (e.g., "Arda")
- **Verification Status:** All imported entries are automatically marked as unverified
  - `verified`: Set to `false`
  - `verified_at`: Set to `null`
  - `verified_by`: Set to `null`
- **Progress Tracking:** Imported entries count towards daily quotas and progress
  - Each imported entry increments the user's daily progress for that entry type
  - Progress is tracked by entry type (e.g., `city_ordinance_section`)
  - Imported entries contribute to quota completion just like manually created entries
- **No manual input required:** These fields are automatically populated during import

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be valid jurisdiction format (e.g., "PH-CEBU-CITY", "PH-MANILA", "PH-QUEZON-CITY")
- Must match pattern: `/^PH-[A-Z]+(-[A-Z]+)*$/`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing required fields** - Ensure all base fields are included (see Critical Validation Requirements above)
2. **Invalid dates** - Use ISO format (e.g., "2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z")
3. **Invalid URLs** - Ensure URLs start with http:// or https://
4. **Empty arrays** - Required arrays (source_urls, tags, elements, penalties) cannot be empty
5. **Incorrect entry_id** - Follow the ORD-{CityName}-{OrdinanceNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp} format
6. **Missing elements/penalties** - City ordinance sections must have at least one element and one penalty
7. **Related sections format** - Use type: "internal" with entry_id for ordinance sections
8. **Legal bases format** - Use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
9. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
   - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
   - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
   - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
   - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
   - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
   - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports

### **Validation Errors:**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure all required fields are present (see Critical Validation Requirements)
- Confirm all URLs are valid and complete
- Check date formats (ISO format: "2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z")
- Confirm elements and penalties arrays have at least one item each
- Verify related_sections use type: "internal" with entry_id for ordinance sections
- Verify legal_bases use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
- Do not include auto-populated fields - they're set automatically on import
