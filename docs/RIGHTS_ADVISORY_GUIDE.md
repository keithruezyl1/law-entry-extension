# üõ°Ô∏è Civilify Law Entry App - Rights Advisory Entry Guide

This guide is specifically designed for creating **Rights Advisory** entries in the Civilify Law Entry App. Rights advisories are practical, user-friendly guides that explain constitutional rights and legal protections in accessible language. They serve as "Bill of Rights cards" that help individuals understand their rights in specific situations like arrest, search, detention, or other legal encounters.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `RIGHTS-{RightsScope}-{Number}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `RIGHTS-Arrest-001-663202`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on rights_scope and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^RIGHTS-[A-Za-z]+-\d+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `RIGHTS-` for rights advisories
2. **Rights Scope:** Extracted from the `rights_scope` field:
   - `"arrest"` ‚Üí `"Arrest"`
   - `"search"` ‚Üí `"Search"`
   - `"detention"` ‚Üí `"Detention"`
3. **Number:** Sequential number for the rights scope (001, 002, 003, etc.)
4. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
5. **Final Format:** `RIGHTS-{RightsScope}-{Number}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input rights_scope: "arrest"
// Generated entry_id: "RIGHTS-Arrest-001-663202"

// Input rights_scope: "search"
// Generated entry_id: "RIGHTS-Search-002-774113"

// Input rights_scope: "detention"
// Generated entry_id: "RIGHTS-Detention-003-889001"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same scope
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Rights scope extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow RIGHTS-{RightsScope}-{Number}-{timestamp} format
type: "rights_advisory"   // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be "PH" or valid jurisdiction name
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character (e.g., "Bill of Rights")
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z")
rights_scope: string    // Must be one of the predefined options (rights_advisory specific)
advice_points: string[] // Must have at least 1 advice point (rights_advisory specific)
legal_bases: object[]   // Must have at least 1 legal basis (rights_advisory specific)
created_by: number      // Team member ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
created_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)
- `rights_scope` must be one of the predefined options
- `advice_points` and `legal_bases` arrays must have at least one item each

### **Vector Embeddings for Imported Entries**
- **Auto-generated:** When entries are imported via JSON, the system automatically generates vector embeddings
- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and AI-powered retrieval functionality
- **Format:** Large array of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.018105285,0.03040041,0.0018285423,...]`)
- **No manual input required:** The embedding field is populated automatically during import
- **Search enhancement:** Embeddings allow the system to find related entries based on semantic meaning, not just exact text matches

### **Import-Specific Field Handling**
- **Created By:** Automatically set to the logged-in user's information
  - `created_by`: Uses the logged-in user's ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
  - `created_by_name`: Uses the logged-in user's name (e.g., "Tagarao")
- **Verification Status:** All imported entries are automatically marked as unverified
  - `verified`: Set to `false`
  - `verified_at`: Set to `null`
  - `verified_by`: Set to `null`
- **Progress Tracking:** Imported entries count towards daily quotas and progress
  - Each imported entry increments the user's daily progress for that entry type
  - Progress is tracked by entry type (e.g., `rights_advisory`)
  - Imported entries contribute to quota completion just like manually created entries
- **No manual input required:** These fields are automatically populated during import

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be "PH" for national rights advisories
- If other jurisdiction, must be title-cased (e.g., "Quezon City", "Cavite")
- Must match pattern: `/^[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+(?:[-' ]+[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+)*(?: City| Province)?$/`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing required fields** - Ensure all base fields are included (see Critical Validation Requirements above)
2. **Invalid dates** - Use ISO format (e.g., "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
3. **Invalid URLs** - Ensure URLs start with http:// or https://
4. **Empty arrays** - Required arrays (source_urls, tags, advice_points, legal_bases) cannot be empty
5. **Incorrect entry_id** - Follow the RIGHTS-{RightsScope}-{Number}-{6-digit-timestamp} format
6. **Invalid rights_scope** - Must be one of the predefined options
7. **Missing advice_points** - Rights advisories must have practical advice points
8. **Missing legal_bases** - Rights advisories must have legal bases
9. **Related sections format** - Use type: "internal" with entry_id for rights advisories
10. **Legal bases format** - Use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
11. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
    - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
    - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
    - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
    - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
    - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
    - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports

### **Validation Errors:**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure all required fields are present (see Critical Validation Requirements)
- Confirm all URLs are valid and complete
- Check date formats (ISO format: "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
- Confirm rights_scope is one of the predefined options
- Verify advice_points and legal_bases arrays have at least one item each
- Verify related_sections use type: "internal" with entry_id for rights advisories
- Verify legal_bases use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
- Do not include auto-populated fields - they're set automatically on import
