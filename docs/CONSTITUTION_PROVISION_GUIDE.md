## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `CONST-{LawFamily}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `CONST-1987Constitution,BillofRights-Article 3, Section 14(2)-663202`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on law_family, section_id and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^CONST-[A-Za-z0-9,() ]+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `CONST-` for constitution provisions
2. **Law Family:** Extracted from the `law_family` field:
   - `"1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights"` ‚Üí `"1987Constitution,BillofRights"`
3. **Section ID:** Extracted from the `section_id` field:
   - `"Article 3, Section 14(2)"` ‚Üí `"Article 3, Section 14(2)"`
4. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
5. **Final Format:** `CONST-{LawFamily}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input law_family: "1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights"
// Input section_id: "Article 3, Section 14(2)"
// Generated entry_id: "CONST-1987Constitution,BillofRights-Article 3, Section 14(2)-663202"

// Input law_family: "1987 Constitution"
// Input section_id: "Article 3 Section 12"
// Generated entry_id: "CONST-1987Constitution-Article 3 Section 12-789012"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same section
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Section ID extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow CONST-{LawFamily}-{SectionID}-{timestamp} format
type: "constitution_provision"  // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be "PH" or valid jurisdiction name
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character (e.g., "1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights")
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2025-09-08T00:00:00.000Z")
topics: string[]        // Must have at least 1 topic (constitution_provision specific)
created_by: number      // Team member ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
created_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)

### **Vector Embeddings for Imported Entries**
- **Auto-generated:** When entries are imported via JSON, the system automatically generates vector embeddings
- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and AI-powered retrieval functionality
- **Format:** Large array of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.018105285,0.03040041,0.0018285423,...]`)
- **No manual input required:** The embedding field is populated automatically during import
- **Search enhancement:** Embeddings allow the system to find related entries based on semantic meaning, not just exact text matches

### **Import-Specific Field Handling**
- **Created By:** Automatically set to the logged-in user's information
  - `created_by`: Uses the logged-in user's ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
  - `created_by_name`: Uses the logged-in user's name (e.g., "Tagarao")
- **Verification Status:** All imported entries are automatically marked as unverified
  - `verified`: Set to `false`
  - `verified_at`: Set to `null`
  - `verified_by`: Set to `null`
- **No manual input required:** These fields are automatically populated during import

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be "PH" for national constitution
- If other jurisdiction, must be title-cased (e.g., "Quezon City", "Cavite")
- Must match pattern: `/^[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+(?:[-' ]+[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+)*(?: City| Province)?$/`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing required fields** - Ensure all base fields are included (see Critical Validation Requirements above)
2. **Invalid dates** - Use ISO format (e.g., "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
3. **Invalid URLs** - Ensure URLs start with http:// or https://
4. **Empty arrays** - Required arrays (source_urls, tags, topics) cannot be empty
5. **Incorrect entry_id** - Follow the CONST-{LawFamily}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp} format
6. **Roman numerals** - Use "Article 3, Section 14(2)" instead of "Art. III, Sec. 14(2)"
7. **Jurisprudence format** - Use array of strings with full case citations and descriptions
8. **Related sections format** - Use type: "internal" with entry_id for constitution provisions
9. **Legal bases format** - Use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
10. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
    - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
    - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
    - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
    - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
    - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
    - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports

### **Validation Errors:**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure all required fields are present (see Critical Validation Requirements)
- Confirm all URLs are valid and complete
- Check date formats (ISO format: "1987-02-02T00:00:00.000Z")
- Confirm topics array has at least one item
- Check that jurisprudence is array of strings with full case citations
- Verify related_sections use type: "internal" with entry_id for constitution provisions
- Verify legal_bases use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
- Do not include auto-populated fields - they're set automatically on import
