## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `CONST-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `CONST-Art3Sec2-123456`, `CONST-Art3Sec12-789012`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on section_id and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^CONST-[A-Za-z0-9]+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `CONST-` for constitution provisions
2. **Section ID:** Extracted from the `section_id` field:
   - `"Article 3 Section 2"` ‚Üí `"Art3Sec2"`
   - `"Article 3 Section 12"` ‚Üí `"Art3Sec12"`
   - `"Article 2 Section 1"` ‚Üí `"Art2Sec1"`
3. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
4. **Final Format:** `CONST-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input section_id: "Article 3 Section 2"
// Generated entry_id: "CONST-Art3Sec2-123456"

// Input section_id: "Article 3 Section 12" 
// Generated entry_id: "CONST-Art3Sec12-789012"

// Input section_id: "Article 2 Section 1"
// Generated entry_id: "CONST-Art2Sec1-456789"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same section
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Section ID extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow CONST-{SectionID}-{timestamp} format
type: "constitution_provision"  // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be "PH" or valid jurisdiction name
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be YYYY-MM-DD format
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be YYYY-MM-DD format
topics: string[]        // Must have at least 1 topic (constitution_provision specific)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be "PH" for national constitution
- If other jurisdiction, must be title-cased (e.g., "Quezon City", "Cavite")
- Must match pattern: `/^[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+(?:[-' ]+[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+)*(?: City| Province)?$/`
