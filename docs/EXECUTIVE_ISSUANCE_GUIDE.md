```

### **üìã Citation Format for References (related_sections & legal_bases)**
```javascript
// External references (legal_bases)
{
  "type": "external",         // For external legal documents
  "citation": "string",       // Full citation text (e.g., "1987 Constitution, Article VII")

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `EXEC-{InstrumentType}{Year}-{Number}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `EXEC-EO2023-001-Sec5-663202`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on law_family, section_id and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^EXEC-[A-Z]+\d+-\d+-[A-Za-z0-9]+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `EXEC-` for executive issuances
2. **Instrument Type:** Extracted from the `law_family` field:
   - `"Executive Order No. 2023-001"` ‚Üí `"EO2023"`
   - `"Administrative Order No. 2023-002"` ‚Üí `"AO2023"`
   - `"Proclamation No. 2023-003"` ‚Üí `"Proc2023"`
3. **Number:** Extracted from the `instrument_no` field:
   - `"Executive Order No. 2023-001"` ‚Üí `"001"`
   - `"Administrative Order No. 2023-002"` ‚Üí `"002"`
4. **Section ID:** Extracted from the `section_id` field:
   - `"Sec. 5"` ‚Üí `"Sec5"`
5. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
6. **Final Format:** `EXEC-{InstrumentType}{Year}-{Number}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input law_family: "Executive Order No. 2023-001"
// Input instrument_no: "Executive Order No. 2023-001"
// Input section_id: "Sec. 5"
// Generated entry_id: "EXEC-EO2023-001-Sec5-663202"

// Input law_family: "Administrative Order No. 2023-002"
// Input instrument_no: "Administrative Order No. 2023-002"
// Input section_id: "Sec. 7"
// Generated entry_id: "EXEC-AO2023-002-Sec7-789012"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same section
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Section ID extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow EXEC-{InstrumentType}{Year}-{Number}-{SectionID}-{timestamp} format
type: "executive_issuance" // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be "PH" or valid jurisdiction name
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character (e.g., "Executive Order No. 2023-001")
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z")
instrument_no: string   // Must be at least 1 character (executive_issuance specific)
created_by: number      // Team member ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
created_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)

### **Vector Embeddings for Imported Entries**
- **Auto-generated:** When entries are imported via JSON, the system automatically generates vector embeddings
- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and AI-powered retrieval functionality
- **Format:** Large array of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.018105285,0.03040041,0.0018285423,...]`)
- **No manual input required:** The embedding field is populated automatically during import
- **Search enhancement:** Embeddings allow the system to find related entries based on semantic meaning, not just exact text matches

### **Import-Specific Field Handling**
- **Created By:** Automatically set to the logged-in user's information
  - `created_by`: Uses the logged-in user's ID (e.g., 5 for Tagarao)
  - `created_by_name`: Uses the logged-in user's name (e.g., "Tagarao")
- **Verification Status:** All imported entries are automatically marked as unverified
  - `verified`: Set to `false`
  - `verified_at`: Set to `null`
  - `verified_by`: Set to `null`
- **Progress Tracking:** Imported entries count towards daily quotas and progress
  - Each imported entry increments the user's daily progress for that entry type
  - Progress is tracked by entry type (e.g., `executive_issuance`)
  - Imported entries contribute to quota completion just like manually created entries
- **No manual input required:** These fields are automatically populated during import

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be "PH" for national executive issuances
- If other jurisdiction, must be title-cased (e.g., "Quezon City", "Cavite")
- Must match pattern: `/^[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+(?:[-' ]+[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+)*(?: City| Province)?$/`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing required fields** - Ensure all base fields are included (see Critical Validation Requirements above)
2. **Invalid dates** - Use ISO format (e.g., "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
3. **Invalid URLs** - Ensure URLs start with http:// or https://
4. **Empty arrays** - Required arrays (source_urls, tags) cannot be empty
5. **Incorrect entry_id** - Follow the EXEC-{InstrumentType}{Year}-{Number}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp} format
6. **Missing instrument_no** - Executive issuances must have an instrument number
7. **Related sections format** - Use type: "internal" with entry_id for issuance sections
8. **Legal bases format** - Use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
9. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
   - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
   - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
   - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
   - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
   - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
   - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports

### **Validation Errors:**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure all required fields are present (see Critical Validation Requirements)
- Confirm all URLs are valid and complete
- Check date formats (ISO format: "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
- Verify related_sections use type: "internal" with entry_id for issuance sections
- Verify legal_bases use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
- Do not include auto-populated fields - they're set automatically on import
