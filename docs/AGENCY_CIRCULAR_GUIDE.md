# üè¢ Civilify Law Entry App - Agency Circular Entry Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide is specifically designed for creating **Agency Circular** entries in the Civilify Law Entry App. Agency circulars are administrative orders, memoranda, and guidelines issued by government agencies like LTO, PNP, DOH, and other regulatory bodies to implement laws and establish operational procedures.

## üèóÔ∏è Agency Circular Entry Structure

### **üìù Base Fields (Required for All Entries)**

```javascript
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated stable ID (e.g., "CIRC-LTO-MC2023-001-Sec3-663202")
type: "agency_circular"   // Always "agency_circular"
title: string            // Human-readable label (e.g., "Driver's License Renewal Procedures")
jurisdiction: string     // Usually "PH" for national agency circulars
law_family: string       // "LTO Memorandum Circular No. 2023-001" or "PNP Administrative Order No. 2023-002"
section_id?: string      // Section/Article (e.g., "Sec. 3", "Art. 2")
canonical_citation: string // Formal cite (e.g., "LTO MC 2023-001, Sec. 3")
status: string           // "active" | "amended" | "repealed" | "draft" | "approved" | "published"
effective_date: string   // ISO date (e.g., "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
amendment_date?: string  // ISO date (only if status = "amended")
summary: string          // 1-3 sentence neutral synopsis
text: string            // Clean, normalized circular text
source_urls: string[]   // Official sources (at least 1 required)
tags: string[]          // Retrieval hints (e.g., ["license", "renewal", "procedures", "LTO"])
last_reviewed: string    // ISO date (auto-set to current date for new entries)
created_by: number       // Team member ID (e.g., 3 for Paden)
created_at: string       // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string       // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
embedding: string        // Vector embedding (auto-generated for imported entries)
```

### **üîí Access Control**
```javascript
visibility: {
  gli: boolean,         // General Legal Information (usually true)
  cpa: boolean         // CPA mode (usually true for agency circulars)
}
```

### **üè¢ Agency Circular-Specific Fields**
```javascript
circular_no: string            // Required: circular number (e.g., "MC 2023-001", "AO 2023-002")
section_no?: string           // Optional: section number if applicable
applicability: string[]       // Optional: who/what the circular applies to
legal_bases: object[]         // Optional: legal bases with full details (Step 4)
related_sections: object[]    // Optional: related circular sections with full details (Step 4)
```

### **üìã Citation Format for References (related_sections & legal_bases)**
```javascript
// External references (legal_bases)
{
  "type": "external",         // For external legal documents
  "citation": "string",       // Full citation text (e.g., "Republic Act No. 4136 (1964)")
  "url": "string",           // Complete URL
  "title": "string",         // Document title (e.g., "Land Transportation and Traffic Code")
  "note": "string"           // Short description
}

// Internal references (related_sections)
{
  "type": "internal",         // For related circular sections
  "entry_id": "string",       // Entry ID of related section
  "title": "string",         // Title of related section
  "url": "string",           // URL to circular text

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Validation Requirements

### **Entry ID Generation**
- **Format:** `CIRC-{Agency}-{CircularNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`
- **Examples:** `CIRC-LTO-MC2023-001-Sec3-663202`
- **Auto-generated:** The system generates this automatically based on law_family, section_id and timestamp
- **Validation:** Must match pattern `/^CIRC-[A-Z]+-[A-Z0-9]+-[A-Za-z0-9]+-\d{6}$/`

#### **How Auto-Generation Works:**
The system automatically generates entry IDs using this process:

1. **Prefix:** Always starts with `CIRC-` for agency circulars
2. **Agency:** Extracted from the `law_family` field:
   - `"LTO Memorandum Circular No. 2023-001"` ‚Üí `"LTO"`
   - `"PNP Administrative Order No. 2023-002"` ‚Üí `"PNP"`
3. **Circular Number:** Extracted from the `circular_no` field:
   - `"MC 2023-001"` ‚Üí `"MC2023-001"`
   - `"AO 2023-002"` ‚Üí `"AO2023-002"`
4. **Section ID:** Extracted from the `section_id` field:
   - `"Sec. 3"` ‚Üí `"Sec3"`
5. **Timestamp:** Last 6 digits of current timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
   - Example: `1705123456789` ‚Üí `"234567"`
6. **Final Format:** `CIRC-{Agency}-{CircularNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp}`

#### **Generation Examples:**
```javascript
// Input law_family: "LTO Memorandum Circular No. 2023-001"
// Input circular_no: "MC 2023-001"
// Input section_id: "Sec. 3"
// Generated entry_id: "CIRC-LTO-MC2023-001-Sec3-663202"

// Input law_family: "PNP Administrative Order No. 2023-002"
// Input circular_no: "AO 2023-002"
// Input section_id: "Sec. 5"
// Generated entry_id: "CIRC-PNP-AO2023-002-Sec5-789012"
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Don't manually set entry_id** - Let the system generate it automatically
- **Unique per entry** - The timestamp ensures uniqueness even for same section
- **Validation required** - Must match the regex pattern for system acceptance
- **Case sensitive** - Section ID extraction preserves original casing

### **Required Fields (Validation Will Fail Without These)**
```javascript
// These fields are REQUIRED and will cause validation errors if missing:
entry_id: string          // Auto-generated, must follow CIRC-{Agency}-{CircularNumber}-{SectionID}-{timestamp} format
type: "agency_circular"   // Must be exactly this string
title: string            // Must be at least 3 characters
jurisdiction: string     // Must be "PH" or valid jurisdiction name
law_family: string       // Must be at least 1 character (e.g., "LTO Memorandum Circular No. 2023-001")
canonical_citation: string // Must be at least 1 character
status: string           // Must be one of: "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
effective_date: string   // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
summary: string          // Must be at least 1 character
text: string            // Must be at least 1 character
source_urls: string[]   // Must have at least 1 valid URL
tags: string[]          // Must have at least 1 tag
last_reviewed: string    // Must be ISO date format (e.g., "2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z")
circular_no: string     // Must be at least 1 character (agency_circular specific)
created_by: number      // Team member ID (e.g., 3 for Paden)
created_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
updated_at: string      // ISO timestamp (auto-generated)
```

### **Cross-Field Validation Rules**
- If `status` is "amended", then `amendment_date` is required
- All URLs in `source_urls` must be valid URLs (start with http:// or https://)

### **Vector Embeddings for Imported Entries**
- **Auto-generated:** When entries are imported via JSON, the system automatically generates vector embeddings
- **Purpose:** Enables semantic search and AI-powered retrieval functionality
- **Format:** Large array of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.018105285,0.03040041,0.0018285423,...]`)
- **No manual input required:** The embedding field is populated automatically during import
- **Search enhancement:** Embeddings allow the system to find related entries based on semantic meaning, not just exact text matches

### **Import-Specific Field Handling**
- **Created By:** Automatically set to the logged-in user's information
  - `created_by`: Uses the logged-in user's ID (e.g., 3 for Paden)
  - `created_by_name`: Uses the logged-in user's name (e.g., "Paden")
- **Verification Status:** All imported entries are automatically marked as unverified
  - `verified`: Set to `false`
  - `verified_at`: Set to `null`
  - `verified_by`: Set to `null`
- **Progress Tracking:** Imported entries count towards daily quotas and progress
  - Each imported entry increments the user's daily progress for that entry type
  - Progress is tracked by entry type (e.g., `agency_circular`)
  - Imported entries contribute to quota completion just like manually created entries
- **No manual input required:** These fields are automatically populated during import

### **Jurisdiction Validation**
- Must be "PH" for national agency circulars
- If other jurisdiction, must be title-cased (e.g., "Quezon City", "Cavite")
- Must match pattern: `/^[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+(?:[-' ]+[A-Za-z√Ä-√ø]+)*(?: City| Province)?$/`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing required fields** - Ensure all base fields are included (see Critical Validation Requirements above)
2. **Invalid dates** - Use ISO format (e.g., "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
3. **Invalid URLs** - Ensure URLs start with http:// or https://
4. **Empty arrays** - Required arrays (source_urls, tags) cannot be empty
5. **Incorrect entry_id** - Follow the CIRC-{Agency}-{CircularNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp} format
6. **Missing circular_no** - Agency circulars must have a circular number
7. **Related sections format** - Use type: "internal" with entry_id for circular sections
8. **Legal bases format** - Use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
9. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
   - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
   - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
   - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
   - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
   - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
   - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports

### **Validation Errors:**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify JSON syntax is correct
- Ensure all required fields are present (see Critical Validation Requirements)
- Confirm all URLs are valid and complete
- Check date formats (ISO format: "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
- Verify related_sections use type: "internal" with entry_id for circular sections
- Verify legal_bases use type: "external" with citation, url, title, note for external documents
- Do not include auto-populated fields - they're set automatically on import

### **Critical GPT Instructions:**
1. **Always include ALL required fields** - Missing any will cause validation failure
2. **Use exact circular text** - Do not paraphrase or summarize
3. **Circular number is REQUIRED** - Must have a valid circular number
4. **Related sections use type: "internal"** - For circular sections, use internal references with entry_id
5. **Legal bases use type: "external"** - For external legal documents, use external references
6. **Entry ID format** - CIRC-{Agency}-{CircularNumber}-{SectionID}-{6-digit-timestamp} (auto-generated by system)
7. **Dates must be ISO format** - Use "2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z" format for dates
8. **URLs must be complete** - Start with http:// or https://
9. **Status must be valid enum** - "active", "amended", "repealed", "draft", "approved", "published"
10. **Auto-populated fields** - Do not include these fields; system populates automatically on import:
    - `embedding` - Vector embedding for semantic search
    - `created_by` - Logged-in user's ID
    - `created_by_name` - Logged-in user's name
    - `verified` - Set to false for all imports
    - `verified_at` - Set to null for all imports
    - `verified_by` - Set to null for all imports
